# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I download the images?
This feature is not working properly yet as LitterTagger is still in development.<br>

## What is LitterTagger?
LitterTagger is an open source solution for creating data about world's litter.

## Why is it called LitterTagger?

## How do I taken pictures?
Firstly, make sure that your phone has the right settings:

 - iPhone. Open Settings -> Privacy -> Location. Turn "Camera On While Using".
 - Android. Open the Camera.

Go to camera settings => Activate Geotagging.<br>
Pull down top-menu and Activate GPS<br>
<br>
There are different ways to take pictures:

 - Open your normal camera and use that to take the photos (our preferred way)
 - Open the app and take pictures from within the app (This is not available yet.)

There are 2 ways to upload and tag your data. You can use the mobile app, or you can use LitterTagger.com and log in there. If you visit the website, you have to upload your images first, then tag them. Some people prefer this way, as you get a full screen, a keyboard, and you can tag many items at once. Other people prefer using the mobile app, where you have to select your images first, tag them, and upload the tagged ones.<br>
Do not forget: Check your setting: do you normally pick up the litter or not?<br>

## What's the use of having an option 'I did not pick it up'?
Isn’t it all about cleaning the earth and picking litter? Good question! Yes, the idea is to make the world a better place, and there are many ways to do that. Most of us pick litter, so right at that moment, a difference is being made, the world is a bit cleaner than before. And we don’t just pick the litter, but we also take a picture to create data about that litter that can be used long after the litter is gone.<br>
However, there are situations when someone would take a picture without picking the litter:

 - The litter is too big. You are walking with your dog and picking some litter while doing so, but suddenly you see something that shouldn’t be there but it is too big. (for example a car-wheel or a broken toilet)
 - It’s too dangerous.
 - You believe that leaving the litter where it was found is making a bigger impact. This might also be true. Some people believe that by removing the litter, you are in fact saying ‘dump whatever you want, I’ll come around and pick it up’. Others believe ‘if the place is clean, it will stay clean for a longer period of time. We ourselves don’t believe in either of them. Anyway, if you want to make an impact by not touching the litter, you can still register it.
 - Someone else can pick it up. Suppose you are in a wheelchair, or late for a meeting. By collecting data, you can create data that other people can respond to. This feature is a future ...
 - The data tells an important story.

 ## Taking pictures and taging them is taking a lot of time, what to do?
 You could try our ‘bulk-tag’option. You can find this on the add-tags page, or your profile. Here you can see the photos that you uploaded from web that you need to tag. If you have similar photos (for instance all pictures with a redbull-can), you can select all of them and then choose ‘start tagging’, now you only have to give the right tags once and these will be applied to all selected pictures. The pictures that were not selected remain so you could repeat the process if you want to. This tool actually works really good, go check it out! 

 ## What kind of pictures should I take?
 - This is entirely up to you and depends on what kind of story you want to take.
 - If you want, you can add 1 tag to each photo.
 - Or, you can include many objects in a single photo.
 - If its not possible to count the litter, you can use the Dumping category (small, medium, large) and pick a number between 0-100 depending on how bad you think the problem is.
 - When possible, hold your camera as close to the item as possible.
 - If there is a brand on the item, make sure that is also visible in the picture.
 -  Don't include people, faces, shadows, feet, or clothes. Please take photos of litter ONLY. With these guidelines, you can help us create an excellent quality datasetset and you will make life easier for those who need to help verify the data. However, there are situations where this is not possible. For instance, you see something floating in the water and are not able to pick it, or turn it to see if there is a brand on it, or to zoom in. That’s okay, it is still valuable data and we welcome your contribution.<br>
Do I have to take 1 photo per item?
 -  No, you don’t. You can take 1 photo, apply a tag of cigarette butts tag with a quantity of 50.
And if I find different objects close together, do i have to sort those first?
 - Some people do this, but its not necessary. It all depends what kind of story you want to tell.
So do whatever you prefer, but do try and help us build a high quality database! 

 ## How to tag correctly?
There is no single method to tag pictures, all data is valuable. It is also 'your story' to tell. However, you should try to tell what kind of item it is (it should be available under some category, and only if it is not, use 'other') and if possible add the brand as well (if the brand is not available yet, you could use the custom tags input). But try to use the pre-defined tags as much as possible.
If possible, tag the ‘worst’ material. So an item with both plastic and paper, tag as plastic.<br>
<br>
Some examples:<br>
red bull can → 2 tags: ‘the object’ (look for the best ‘can’ that you can find) + brand<br>
Soda can with a brand that we don’t have yet → 1 predefined tag (can) + 1 customtag:somebrandname<br>
If you have found an energy-can, only give 1 tag for the item: so don’t tag it as ‘can’ and ‘energycan’, but just as an energycan<br>
<br>
Multiple litter items in a photo can be tagged with appropriate counts applied. A photo can contain a mixture of beer bottles, beer cans, plastic cups, or any number of recognized category items. Multiple recognized brands and their counts can also be applied. <br>
