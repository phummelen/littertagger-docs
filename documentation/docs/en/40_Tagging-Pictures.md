# Adding Characteristics to Photos

Adding characteristics to photos is crucial after uploading them. This manual process involves identifying objects and providing details like materials and brands. Here's how it works:

Go to 'My Photos' and select a photo.
Identify the object in the photo from a list or type to search.
Choose the correct item.
Add details like materials, brands, or events if applicable.
Indicate whether you picked up the item and/or other information like deposit etc
Proceed to the next photo or navigate using CTRL + arrow keys.
This process is currently manual but may evolve to be more automated in the future.

These are the essential steps but a lot more can be said about this process, if you encounter any issues, or have questions about the process, feel free to contact us!
