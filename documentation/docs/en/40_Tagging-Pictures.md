# Adding Characteristics to Photos

Adding characteristics to photos is perhaps the most crucial task at the moment. After the photos are uploaded, they are there, but it's not yet known what is in those photos. This is something we currently have to do manually, and it's our 'job' as the creators of this program to make it as easy as possible so that you can spend your time on more enjoyable activities. (In the future, this manual work may not be necessary as computers become more capable of recognition, but we're not there yet).

Tagging a photo involves several steps, outlined as follows:

1. Go to 'My Photos' and click on a photo you want to add characteristics to.
2. The photo opens, prompting you to identify the object in the photo. This is likely to be only one object, but in theory, there could be more. Start with the first object you want to tag and search for the right object in the list of possibilities. You can scroll through the list until you find the correct item, or you can start typing. Options that match what you've typed will be displayed in the list, regardless of where the typed text appears in the name. The initial name is already displayed (the first in the list), and if you start typing, it disappears immediately, saving time.
3. Once you've found the item, select it. If you can't find the item in the list, you can choose 'OTHER,' which is also in the list. After selecting the correct object, click on 'Add object' (you can also do this by using the tab key to navigate to 'Add object' and pressing ENTER).
4. After indicating the type of item, you can provide additional details, if applicable. This could include the material it's made of (you can choose multiple materials if needed), the brand of the item, and possibly an 'Event,' such as indicating that this item was specifically picked up during World Cleanup Day. Again, the entire text is already selected, so it disappears when you start typing, saving time.
5. Clicking on 'Add material/brand/event' will display the chosen value on the screen. If you mistakenly chose this option, clicking on it again will remove it. You can also choose 'OTHER' for each of these options if the correct material/brand/event is not listed. We will then try to see if we need to add any missing values.
6. In the same window, there is an indication of whether you picked it up or not. It adopts the default value you filled in your profile, but if this setting is incorrect for this specific object, you can adjust it here.
7. If there were no other objects in the photo, you are now ready to go back to 'My Photos' or click 'Next Photo' to move on to the next one.
8. You can reach 'Next' or 'Previous' (the next or previous photo with no tags) by pressing CTRL + arrow left or right.
9. If there were more objects in the photo, you can choose a different object value (or leave it the same) and select 'add object' again. This will bring up a second input screen where you can follow the same steps.

This is the general process, but as mentioned, it involves a lot of manual work. We expect this part of the program to undergo the most changes to provide users with more convenient or faster ways to add characteristics to a multitude of photos.
