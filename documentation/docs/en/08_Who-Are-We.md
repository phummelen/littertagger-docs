# Who are we?

Hi, I’m Fred, a volunteer with LitterApp from the Netherlands. I pick up a lot of litter and use the app (website) regularly. Beyond that, I contribute by finding bugs, improving documentation, generating ideas, helping users, managing socials, and creating videos.

In my spare time, I stay active. My wife and I repurpose discarded materials into wooden objects, selling them to friends and family. The proceeds go to various charities—a win-win!

I also enjoy cycling and running, always picking up litter along the way.

I firmly believe every small effort helps make the world a better place. I’m proud to be part of a team dedicated to cleaning the planet and using LitterApp to document the impact.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

Walking with my dog, I was frustrated about the litter I found in my neighbourhood.
Considering our neighbourhood as an extension of our garden, I started to clean up.
Inspired by different persons, I started making photos of litter and collecting data in 2017.

I've used different apps, but I've settled on using the LitterApp. To put in my photo's, tag them and do some analyses.

My work is partly my hobby too, so I'm the DevOps guy that's managing the LitterApp backend.
Also helping as a product owner of the LitterApp application and integrations.

One of my hobbies is also (speed-) road cycling. When I'm on my bike, I stop only on rare occassions to pick up litter.

**One piece at the time** is a slogan I've heared more times ... and my litter picking is an daily addiction to me nowdays!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for software architecture and programming best practices. I'm not a litterpicker, but I support the work of Fred, Pieter, and the community in the way I know, building the website piece by piece, adding new features, and polishing existing ones.
