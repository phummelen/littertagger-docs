# Who are we?

## Fred Steenbergen

Hi, my name is Fred, I live in the Netherlands and I am one of the volunteers with LitterApp.
I pick a lot of litter, so I am using the app (website) a lot, but I am also trying to do my part with improving the program itself by finding bugs, improving documentation, coming up with new ideas, helping people etc etc.

In my spare time I am always active. Together with my wife, I create wooden objects by recycling stuff that other people throw away and we sell this to friends/family and with the money that we make, we support several charities. A win-win-combination.

Apart from that, I like to cycle and run, and while doing so, i always pick litter as well.

I really believe that every small bit helps in some way to make the world a bit better and I am proud to be part of a group of dedicated people, cleaning the world, and using LitterApp to register the data.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!
