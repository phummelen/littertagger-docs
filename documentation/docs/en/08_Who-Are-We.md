# Who are we?

## Fred Steenbergen

Hi, my name is Fred, I live in the Netherlands and I am one of the volunteers with LitterApp.
I pick a lot of litter, so I am using the app (website) a lot, but I am also trying to do my part with improving the program itself by finding bugs, improving documentation, coming up with new ideas, helping people, doing te socials and creating videos.

In my spare time I am always active. Together with my wife, I create wooden objects by recycling stuff that other people throw away and we sell this to friends/family and with the money that we make, we support several charities. A win-win-combination.

Apart from that, I like to cycle and run, and while doing so, I always pick litter as well.

I really believe that every small bit helps in some way to make the world a bit better and I am proud to be part of a group of dedicated people, cleaning the world, and using LitterApp to register the data.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

Walking with my dog, I was frustrated about the litter I found in my neighbourhood.
Considering our neighbourhood as an extension of our garden, I started to clean up.
Inspired by different persons, I started making photos of litter and collecting data in 2017.

I've used different apps, but I've settled on using the LitterApp. To put in my photo's, tag them and do some analyses.

My work is partly my hobby too, so I'm the DevOps guy that's managing the LitterApp backend.
Also helping as a product owner of the LitterApp application and integrations.

One of my hobbies is also (speed-) road cycling. When I'm on my bike, I stop only on rare occassions to pick up litter.

**One piece at the time** is a slogan I've heared more times ... and my litter picking is an daily addiction to me nowdays!
