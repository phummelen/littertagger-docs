# Who are we?

## Fred Steenbergen

Hi, my name is Fred and I am one of the volunteers with LitterApp.
I think it is a strange time we are living in with a lot of opportunities but also a lot of problems and instead of complaining about them, I'd rather do some things that I am able to do.
Within LitterApp I am one of the 'power-users', I pick a lot of litter so I use the program a lot as a user. But I am also trying to do my part with improving the program itself by finding bugs, improving documentation, coming up with new ideas, helping people etc etc.

In my spare time I am always active. Together with my wife, I create wooden objects by recycling stuff that other people throw away and we sell this to friends/family and with the money that we make, we support several charities. A win-win-combination.

Apart from that, I like to cycle and run, and while doing so, i always pick litter as well.

I really believe that every small bit helps in some way to make the world a bit better and I am proud to be part of a group of dedicated people, working on LitterApp.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!
