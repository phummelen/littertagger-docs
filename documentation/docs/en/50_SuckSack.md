# Event SuckSack (#zuigzak)

The Plastic Avengers started a new event and of course we are going to support that event via LitterApp as well:

SuckSack or ZuigZak in Dutch.

Their explanation:

"Since the introduction of a deposit on cans and bottles, 'drink pouches' have been on the rise in litter. Manufacturers are trying to circumvent the deposit system by selling their TO-GO drinks in these pouches. Manufacturers who feel no responsibility for the packaging they put on the market. Manufacturers who deliberately undermine the deposit system, solely for their own profit. And they do this with packaging that is both prone to becoming litter and non-recyclable. It's time to put these manufacturers in the spotlight."

We at LitterApp support this event with data and also display our data on the map.
