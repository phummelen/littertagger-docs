We don't communicate on behalf of LitterApp. We are volunteers working together on something meaningful, and each of these volunteers has their own opinions, free to share them through their individual channels. You can reach 'us' through these channels. Below are a few of those possibilities. If you want to be included in this list, contact us, and we'd be happy to add you!

# Slack as a meeting place
However, we do have a kind of 'meeting place' where we come together. We use the chat program Slack, where you can easily join with your questions or ideas. If you'd like to be added, reach out to one of us; we welcome you warmly!
