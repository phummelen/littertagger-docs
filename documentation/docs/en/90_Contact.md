LitterApp is run by volunteers. Some of them maintain a LitterApp-account, for instance on Facebook or Bluesky, while others just use their own personal account and post about anything, including things related to LitterApp.

# Slack as a meeting place
We use Slack as our meeting-place, here the community comes together and talk about plans, suggestions, wishes etc. You are welcome as a new user, but you need an invite for that. If you'd like to be added, reach out to one of us; we welcome you warmly!
