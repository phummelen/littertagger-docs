# Events

Events are organized worldwide, and you can participate in them just like any other litter-picking activity. However, it can be worthwhile to add the name of the event to your characteristics so that you, or others, can collect data about it.

To facilitate this, we have a separate field called 'Event,' where you can select one or more values. Here's an example of how this could work:

Suppose you participate in the World Cleanup Day every year, and you want to showcase the data you collected on that day. In addition to providing characteristics as usual, you also select the 'Event = World Cleanup Day' for each item. This allows you to show what you (or others) have collected on (one or more) World Cleanup Days at any time.

If you participate in the World Cleanup Day again next year, you repeat the process. It will then be possible to show what was collected on one or more World Cleanup Days by applying date filters.

If you want to do the same for your own event but don't see it listed, please contact us, and we will add it.

Below are some existing events, but this list can be expanded.

1. World Cleanup Day
2. Landelijke Opschoon Dag
3. PeukMeuk
4. Canuary
5. Cleanup4Sarah
6. ZaandeWandel
7. Plastic Avengers - Bakzeil
8. RedBullLitter

# Special Events

## Before and After
We use events for cleanups but also for other events that deserve attention. For instance, we use them for special places where two photos are taken: one of the polluted site and another from the same viewpoint but cleaned up.

For this, we use two events:
- Photo 1: BeforeAndAfter & BeforeAndAfter_Before
- Photo 2: BeforeAndAfter & BeforeAndAfter_After.

This allows you to search for and display these photos.

## Show Your Impact
This is again a special tag used for 'end photos,' where you showcase a clean area with a few trash bags collected. This allows you to demonstrate your impact with a powerful photo without necessarily documenting each individual item (though you can if you choose).

Photo: ShowYourImpact, possibly with an additional tag like ShowYourImpact_ZaanseZwerfvuilEstafette if you want to associate it with the name of your cleanup group.

If your group is not listed, and you want to use this tag to showcase your photos, please contact us, and we'll be happy to add it.
