# Cable Ties Along the Roadside

In Steenwijk, there's a road that runs from the train station to the highway.
This road is designed to accommodate the transportation of military equipment.
It's a wide road, perfect for high speeds!

One of our waste collectors lives near this road. They found a huge amount of cable ties there.
What was striking was that they started at a specific point.

Near the station, there's a company that manufactures spraying machines. These machines also need to be tested,
both in terms of driving and extending and retracting the spray arms.
The waste collector approached some employees who were smoking outside and asked if the cable ties might be theirs.
They indicated that was a possibility.

On request, an email was sent to the company. The production manager took action.
And the number of cable ties along the road has been reduced to practically nothing.

Upon further inquiry, it turned out... a small step has been added to the production process.
The machine that is about to go for a test drive is blown off with compressed air.
And that's how most of the cable ties are now captured within the company premises.

## Conclusion

By paying attention to a specific type of waste, seeing a connection, and taking (local) action, a stream of litter has been eliminated.
