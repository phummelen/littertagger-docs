# User Creation and Profile

You can create your own user with all expected features like changing your password.

At LitterApp, we aim to be more than just a 'litter registration app'; it's about the impact you can make. As a user, you are crucial in this process. Without you, nothing gets registered, and no impact is made. We emphasize the individual through the profile page.

On your profile page, you can share personal details via a profile picture, whether it's a photo of yourself, an interesting item you found, or your favorite book.

The profile page is also the page where you can set defaults for the litter you pick like being picked up or not, or having deposit or not etc.

In the future , the profile page will have more options to tell more about yourself, to be continued!

If you have any questions regarding your account, feel free to contact us!
