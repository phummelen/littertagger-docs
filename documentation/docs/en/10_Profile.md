# User Creation and Profile

At LitterApp, we aim to be more than just a 'litter registration app'; it's about the impact we can make. So you, the user, are crucial in this process. Without you, nothing gets registered, and no impact is made. We emphasize the individual through the profile page.

On your profile page, you can share personal details via a profile picture, whether it's a photo of yourself, an interesting item you found, or your favorite book.

# Setting the default values
The profile page is also the page where you can set defaults for the litter you pick like being picked up or not, or having deposit or not etc.

In the future, the profile page will have more options to tell more about yourself, to be continued!

If you have any questions regarding your account, feel free to contact us!
