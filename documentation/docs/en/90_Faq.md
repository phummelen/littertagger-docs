# Frequently Asked Questions

If you are new to LitterApp, you probably will encounter many questions. Most questions are asked through our central meeting place, Slack, but questions can also come from other places.

We will always do our best to answer questions as quickly and clearly as possible. However, there is also a chance that certain questions are asked frequently, and it might be better to include them in the so-called 'FAQ,' the 'Frequently Asked Questions.'

Below, we attempt to collect the most frequently asked questions.

## Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap, and why don't you support them?

**Answer**:

This is a valid and sensitive question, raised even by the founder of OpenLitterMap (OLM).

Many LitterApp participants have a history with OLM, contributing to its development. Users joined through word of mouth, offering solutions, creating new languages, creating documentation, populating the database, acting as ambassadors, promoting to authorities, creating instructional videos, welcoming new members, and being featured in media. They were proud of their contributions.

However, when decisions shifted from the community to the founder, meetups were canceled, and the focus turned to securing funds for hiring developers. This direction was unwelcome, claiming that developers should be paid is not motivating to the users who are doing their 'job' for free. The founder's negative social media statements overshadowed volunteers' positive contributions, leading to disillusionment. Volunteers joined OLM in a search for camaraderie and collaboration but ended up doing damage control, often unsuccessfully. Many distanced themselves, while some continued trying to influence decisions until it became too much.

The choice was made to build something outside of OLM, that made it possible to tag litter and feed that information into OLM. In that way we would be able to do the software-development, without having to wait for the founder to find time to do some reviewing. However, this initiative (aka 'LitterTagger') was not welcomedd either, resulting in the decission to start something new. Working with motivated volunteers on a beautiful product without a single bottleneck, allowing anyone to participate and learn from others to keep progressing together.


## Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

**Answer**:

No, LitterApp is different. It may not be immediately different in function, as it remains one of the means to achieve a cleaner world. Still, it differs in the way it is developed. LitterApp is open-source, meaning the code is available to everyone, which is already a distinction from some other programs. Additionally, we ensure that it remains low-cost. We sustain ourselves without having to apply for funds. If there are costs, users collectively cover them. Furthermore, we firmly believe in the community. LitterApp does not belong to one person; it is not one person who must do everything or sacrifice everything to make it work. It does not come to a standstill if one person is absent. We are a group of volunteers, and anyone who wants to play a role can do so. Our idea is 'Pay it forward.' Newcomers are welcomed and guided by those who have been involved longer and know about it. All we ask in return is that you do the same for the next users who join. Community-driven, as it should be.


## What should I do if I find an item or a brand etc that is not in the list?

**Answer**:

This is always a possibility. While we have made a long list of choices with some volunteers, we know that the list is far from complete. There is so much litter, with different types, materials, and brands, that the list will never be exhaustive.

In that case, contact us, explain what you are doing and get an invitation to Slack. In Slack we discuss several objects, but we also have a channel where you can indicate what object or brand etc you are missing. If you do, one of our volunteers will make sure that it will be added so you can use it.
