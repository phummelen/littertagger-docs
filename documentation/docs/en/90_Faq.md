# Frequently Asked Questions

At the time of writing, we have just started with LitterApp, which naturally raises many questions. Most questions are asked through our central meeting place, Slack, but questions can also come from other places.

We will always do our best to answer questions as honestly and clearly as possible. However, there is also a chance that certain questions are asked frequently, and it might be better to include them in the so-called 'FAQ,' the 'Frequently Asked Questions.' These questions can be related to LitterApp itself or, for example, questions about how to upload photos.

Ideally, the latter question should not be necessary, but our initial focus is on creating a functional program. Some aspects may not be entirely clear yet, and we hope that clarity will come in the next version.

Below, we attempt to place and answer the most frequently asked questions.

**Question**: 

Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap, and why don't you support them?

**Answer**:

This is a valid and sensitive question, raised even by the founder of OpenLitterMap (OLM).

Many LitterApp participants have a history with OLM, contributing to its development. Users joined through word of mouth, offering solutions, creating new languages, creating documentation, populating the database, acting as ambassadors, promoting to authorities, creating instructional videos, welcoming new members, and being featured in media. They were proud of their contributions.

However, when decisions shifted from the community to the founder, meetups were canceled, and the focus turned to securing funds for hiring. This direction was unwelcome. The founder's negative social media statements overshadowed volunteers' positive contributions, leading to disillusionment. Volunteers sought camaraderie and collaboration but ended up doing damage control, often unsuccessfully. Many distanced themselves, while some continued trying to influence decisions until it became too much.

Efforts to connect to OLM for program improvements (originally 'LitterTagger') were blocked. Most had already distanced themselves, and a new path was chosen: working with motivated volunteers on a beautiful product without a single bottleneck, allowing anyone to participate and learn from others to keep progressing together.


**Question**: Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

No, LitterApp is different. It may not be immediately different in function, as it remains one of the means to achieve a cleaner world. Still, it differs in the way it is developed. LitterApp is open-source, meaning the code is available to everyone, which is already a distinction from some other programs. Additionally, we ensure that it remains low-cost. We sustain ourselves without having to apply for funds. If there are costs, users collectively cover them. Furthermore, we firmly believe in the community. LitterApp does not belong to one person; it is not one person who must do everything or sacrifice everything to make it work. It does not come to a standstill if one person is absent. We are a group of volunteers, and anyone who wants to play a role can do so. Our idea is 'Pay it forward.' Newcomers are welcomed and guided by those who have been involved longer and know about it. All we ask in return is that you do the same for the next users who join. Community-driven, as it should be.

**Question**: What should I do if I find something but it is not in the list?

This is always a possibility. While we have made a long list of choices with some volunteers, we know that the list is far from complete. There is so much litter, with different types, materials, and brands, that the list will never be exhaustive.

In such cases, look for the value "OTHER" and choose that. Then, provide all the other characteristics you can find (or also choose "OTHER" there). We try to keep an eye on this; if, for example, we see that "OTHER" is used as a brand, and we can read the brand that seems to be missing from the list, we will add it. Since this can be a significant puzzle

 for us (e.g., for an event that does not exist, which we cannot guess), we also ask you to contact us and let us know what you miss. This makes it easy for us to add the right one. Once it is added, we ask you to correct your data yourself (remove the chosen 'OTHER' and replace it with the recently added value). This way, we maintain accurate data.
