# Frequently Asked Questions

New to LitterApp? You might have questions. Most are answered via Slack, but we’ve listed common ones below.

## Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap (OLM), and why don’t you support them?

Many LitterApp users previously contributed to OLM. However, changes in decision-making and focus led to volunteers feeling unheard. After failed attempts to improve things within OLM, LitterApp was created—a collaborative, open platform where motivated volunteers can work without bottlenecks.

## Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

No, LitterApp is unique. It’s open-source, low-cost, and community-driven. Costs are covered collectively by users, and the project doesn’t depend on one person. Everyone can contribute and guide newcomers, following the ‘pay it forward’ principle. Together, we work for a cleaner world.

## What should I do if I find an item or brand missing from the list?

Our list is extensive but not complete. If something’s missing, contact us and request access to Slack. In Slack, you can report missing items or brands, and a volunteer will add them to the list.

## I'm new to LitterApp, i've uploaded my first picture but can't find it on the map. How come?

First of all, thanks for joining and giving it a try, you are almost there but there seems to be something missing...
The GPS-location.

This can have several reasons and we will go through some of them:
- your phone is set nót to store gps-location. In that case we can't tell where the picture was taken, and we can not show the dot on the map.
- your phone is set to store gps-location, but it is lost somewhere. There can be several reasons for this:
  - You sent the picture via a progrem to another location before upload, for instance via whatsapp. Whatsapp removes gps-locations.
  - You uploaded the picture via your phone. At this moment some users have issues doing it like that. Somehow the picture has gps-location, but after uploading, we can see that the gps is lost somewhere. However, some other users don't have that problem so we are not sure yet what is causing it. (browser-version? Phone-version?)

What can I do to solve it?
The way that seems to work for all users, is to move the pictures from the phone to the computer. This can be done by connecting your phone to your computer and copying the photos, or maybe you can copy them from a cloud-backup, without even having to connect the phone. Once they are on the computer, you can try to upload some of them. Changes are that now you do see the dot on the map. If not, contact us to see if we can help you.
