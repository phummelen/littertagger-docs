# Frequently Asked Questions

New to LitterApp? You might have questions. Most are answered via Slack, but we’ve listed common ones below.

## Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap (OLM), and why don’t you support them?

Many LitterApp users previously contributed to OLM. However, changes in decision-making and focus led to volunteers feeling unheard. 

After failed attempts to improve things within OLM, LitterApp was created—a collaborative, open platform where motivated volunteers can work without bottlenecks.

## Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

No, LitterApp is unique. It’s open-source, low-cost, and community-driven. 

Costs are covered collectively by users, and the project doesn’t depend on one person. Everyone can contribute and guide newcomers, following the ‘pay it forward’ principle. 

Together, we work for a cleaner world.

## What should I do if I find an item or brand missing from the list?

Our list is extensive but not complete. If something’s missing, contact us and request access to Slack. 

In Slack, you can report missing items or brands, and a volunteer will add them to the list.

## I'm new to LitterApp, I’ve uploaded my first picture but can't find it on the map. How come?

First of all, thanks for joining and giving it a try! You’re almost there, but it seems there’s something missing... The GPS-location.

This can have several reasons, and we will go through some of them:

- Your phone is set **not** to store GPS-location. In that case, we can't tell where the picture was taken, and we cannot show the dot on the map.
- Your phone is set to store GPS-location, but it is lost somewhere. There can be several reasons for this:
  - You sent the picture via a program to another location before upload (e.g., via WhatsApp). WhatsApp removes GPS-locations.
  - You uploaded the picture via your phone. Some users have issues doing it this way. Somehow, the picture has a GPS-location, but after uploading, we see that the GPS is lost somewhere. However, some other users don’t experience this problem, so we’re not sure yet what is causing it (browser version? Phone version?).

### What can I do to solve it?

The method that seems to work for all users is to move the pictures from the phone to the computer. 

This can be done by connecting your phone to your computer and copying the photos, or by copying them from a cloud backup without even having to connect the phone. 

Once they’re on the computer, try uploading some of them. There’s a good chance you will now see the dot on the map.

If not, contact us so we can help you further.
