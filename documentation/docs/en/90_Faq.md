# Frequently Asked Questions

At the time of writing, we have just started with LitterApp, which naturally raises many questions. Most questions are asked through our central meeting place, Slack, but questions can also come from other places.

We will always do our best to answer questions as honestly and clearly as possible. However, there is also a chance that certain questions are asked frequently, and it might be better to include them in the so-called 'FAQ,' the 'Frequently Asked Questions.' These questions can be related to LitterApp itself or, for example, questions about how to upload photos.

Ideally, the latter question should not be necessary, but our initial focus is on creating a functional program. Some aspects may not be entirely clear yet, and we hope that clarity will come in the next version.

Below, we attempt to place and answer the most frequently asked questions.

**Question**: Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap, and why don't you support them?

This is a valid and sensitive question, even raised by the founder of OpenLitterMap (OLM).

Several participants in LitterApp have a history with OpenLitterMap and have played a role in the development of the program.

Most users started using it through word of mouth and actively contributed to solutions, language localization, documentation creation, populating the database with waste data, acting as ambassadors in their countries, promoting the program to authorities, creating instructional videos, welcoming and guiding new members, being featured in newspapers, or mentioning the program in promotional films for large cleanups. Everyone from that period was proud of their contributions and shared that pride.

However, things changed when decisions were no longer made by the community but by the founder. Meetups were canceled, and the collaboration turned from working with motivated volunteers to "we need funds so that I can hire people." This signaled a direction that many did not want. When the funds did not materialize, it worsened. All the positive contributions by volunteers on social media were overshadowed by the negative statements made by the founder. It became a broken record of complaints; because he had worked non-stop on the program for years, he believed he was entitled to those funds, and anyone who disagreed faced backlash.

Volunteers and participants were left disillusioned. They had joined for camaraderie and to work together on a beautiful product, but now, they spent evenings doing damage control, asking, even pleading, for certain statements to be removed. Without results. Some decided to disassociate themselves from the program, while others, hoping for better times, continued to try to influence decisions. Eventually, it became enough.

Efforts were made to create a kind of connection to OLM so that improvements to the program could continue. It was meant to be a program that would significantly enhance the process of assigning characteristics, after which those characteristics would still go to OpenLitterMap (hence the originally chosen name 'LitterTagger'). However, this was also blocked. By that time, most had distanced themselves from the program, and it was decided to take a different path with a clear goal in mind: to work with motivated volunteers on a beautiful product, without a single bottleneck that could impede progress. It should be something where anyone who wants to can participate and gain knowledge from others who already understand it, to keep it moving forward together.

**Question**: Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

No, LitterApp is different. It may not be immediately different in function, as it remains one of the means to achieve a cleaner world. Still, it differs in the way it is developed. LitterApp is open-source, meaning the code is available to everyone, which is already a distinction from some other programs. Additionally, we ensure that it remains low-cost. We sustain ourselves without having to apply for funds. If there are costs, users collectively cover them. Furthermore, we firmly believe in the community. LitterApp does not belong to one person; it is not one person who must do everything or sacrifice everything to make it work. It does not come to a standstill if one person is absent. We are a group of volunteers, and anyone who wants to play a role can do so. Our idea is 'Pay it forward.' Newcomers are welcomed and guided by those who have been involved longer and know about it. All we ask in return is that you do the same for the next users who join. Community-driven, as it should be.

**Question**: What should I do if I find something but it is not in the list?

This is always a possibility. While we have made a long list of choices with some volunteers, we know that the list is far from complete. There is so much litter, with different types, materials, and brands, that the list will never be exhaustive.

In such cases, look for the value "OTHER" and choose that. Then, provide all the other characteristics you can find (or also choose "OTHER" there). We try to keep an eye on this; if, for example, we see that "OTHER" is used as a brand, and we can read the brand that seems to be missing from the list, we will add it. Since this can be a significant puzzle

 for us (e.g., for an event that does not exist, which we cannot guess), we also ask you to contact us and let us know what you miss. This makes it easy for us to add the right one. Once it is added, we ask you to correct your data yourself (remove the chosen 'OTHER' and replace it with the recently added value). This way, we maintain accurate data.
