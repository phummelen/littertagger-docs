# Frequently Asked Questions

New to LitterApp? You might have questions. Most are answered via Slack, but we’ve listed common ones below.

## Are you a splinter group from OpenLitterMap (OLM), and why don’t you support them?

Many LitterApp users previously contributed to OLM. However, changes in decision-making and focus led to volunteers feeling unheard. After failed attempts to improve things within OLM, LitterApp was created—a collaborative, open platform where motivated volunteers can work without bottlenecks.

## Is LitterApp a copy of an existing program?

No, LitterApp is unique. It’s open-source, low-cost, and community-driven. Costs are covered collectively by users, and the project doesn’t depend on one person. Everyone can contribute and guide newcomers, following the ‘pay it forward’ principle. Together, we work for a cleaner world.

## What should I do if I find an item or brand missing from the list?

Our list is extensive but not complete. If something’s missing, contact us and request access to Slack. In Slack, you can report missing items or brands, and a volunteer will add them to the list.
