# Using ShortCuts to speedup tagging

With the regular way of tagging you have to add all different fields to an item.
Even, you have to start adding the item!

During literpicking, you will find similar items on a walk or in several walks.
For example grabbing cigarette butts. I always make a photo from two, four or six butts. Based on the "a butt is never alone" principle.
Especially on the yearly *buttsmut* day, I do pick up a lot of butts.

Tagging those butts one by one or two by two ... there is where *speed tagging* comes in. Using shortcuts for known items will speed up the tagging.
On this page, I will describe the setup and usage of shortcuts. Speedtagging has a second pillar, that's the *keyboard-keys* that can be used to tag without using a mouse.

## Enable the option

ON the right (almost) top, there is a settings icon (the wheel). Clicking on it, you have the option to enable the *Tag Shortcuts* method.
It will give you an extra input field in the photo tagging screen.

Now you can enter shortcuts ... but, there are no shortcuts yet. So let's the first shortcut.

## Adding a shortcut

Shortcuts are user specific, so you can find your own shortcuts in the profile section.
The profile section is on the top right, the option to choose is *Tag Shortcuts*.
You will get a screen with all the already defined shortcuts. So the screen could be empty if no shortcuts are defined yet.

...

## Copying Shortcuts

It's possible to copy shortcuts from one user to another one. Even a shortcut can be copied to all users.
This option is available for the core team, that has accees to the code within the Docker container.
Just ask one of the core team member if you wnat to get a shortcut copied.
