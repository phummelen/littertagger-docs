# Welcome to LitterApp!

Let's start by saying that we are delighted you've found this guide, and we hope you find it helpful!

Around the world, many people are actively picking up litter. This can be done individually during a dog walk or as part of a group. Some do it daily, others only on a special occasion.

Whether you pick up a lot or a little, frequently or occasionally, or perhaps never before, you are warmly welcomed to LitterApp!

LitterApp is a platform where different groups of people come together, including litter pickers, software developers, researchers, students, teachers, and even companies and individuals involved in waste management or zero-waste initiatives.

Whatever your motivation, ambition, or skill, you are welcome, and if you wish, there's probably something you can contribute. Every little bit helps, and everyone can make a difference!

LitterApp is used to bring all these parties together, and the common thread currently is 'waste.'

Although there are already several waste-related programs, each serving a specific purpose or interest, we recently decided to take a different path. Several of the initiators have been involved in one or more programs and concluded that those did not meet their needs. They also couldn't find a suitable alternative.

There could be various reasons for this; some were looking for a specific type of data that was not documented anywhere, others wanted to capture a certain type of data not possible with existing tools, and yet another person found the program they used okay but wanted a way to contribute to it.

That was the moment when we looked at each other and asked, 'Should we really do it ourselves, then?'. The answer was yes, and now we are here, hoping that you will find the data you are looking for, or be able to record the data you want to document, or have the opportunity with us to contribute to the program. Something for everyone, together with a group of enthusiastic volunteers, all with the goal of making the world a little more beautiful and making a difference!

As mentioned earlier, we are participants with different backgrounds and specialties. This diversity is great because we already have a long list of things we want to create for you, and we have enthusiastically started working on them.

Our goal is to do things in small pieces continually. Not suddenly a massive release once a year where users don't know what has changed. No, we work with the users and try to come up with newer/better software as often as possible so that it can be used immediately, and we can use the feedback in the next development cycle.

Due to this way of working, the program may change quickly. A button that was on the left in the previous version might be on the right in the next one because it's more user-friendly, etc. That's why we write this documentation at a high level and not at the level of 'press the button in the top left corner,' as that button might not be there anymore.

We understand that it might take some getting used to and that detailed, up-to-date information might be missing. Don't despair; everyone participating is doing so because they have a specific goal in mind, and part of that is 'training' the next person. So, if you have questions, feel free to ask; there is always someone around who can help, and if they don't know, they will refer you to someone who does. No one knows everything, but together we can go a long way!

Once again, welcome. Thank you for your interest. Take a look around, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!

The team of volunteers from LitterApp.
