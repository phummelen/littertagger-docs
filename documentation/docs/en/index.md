# Welcome to LitterApp!

We're thrilled you've found this documentation and hope you find it helpful!

LitterApp brings together individuals, groups, and organizations involved in litter picking, waste management, and zero-waste initiatives. Whether you pick up litter frequently or are just starting, you're welcome here.

Our platform was created because existing waste-related programs didn't meet all our needs. We wanted a place to gather specific data, contribute easily, and connect with like-minded people. With a diverse team of volunteers, we aim to make a difference and continually improve our software based on user feedback.

Changes happen quickly here, so our documentation focuses on general guidance. If you have specific questions, don't hesitate to ask, someone will always help you out.

Thank you for joining us. Explore and enjoy!
