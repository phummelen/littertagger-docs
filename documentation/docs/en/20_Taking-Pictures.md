# Taking a Photo

How to take a photo probably doesn't need much explanation: you open your phone's camera and take a picture. However, because it's a photo of litter, and there's a lot to be done with that photo afterward, there are some things to consider:

Firstly, unlike some other programs, we do accept photos without GPS location. We intentionally do this because photos without an exact location can still have value. If you do want to include a location in your photos, for example, to display them on a map, you need to set your device to save the GPS location with your photo. Other data, such as date and time, is automatically saved.

As of writing this documentation, we don't do anything with the photo itself. You are the creator of the photo and you personally review the photo to assign the correct characteristics. Since you took the photo yourself, you probably know best what's in it. However, others are likely to view the photo as well, so it's essential that the photo is suitable. Here are a few considerations:

- Preferably, no recognizable people, except yourself, if you're comfortable with that, in the photo.
- Focus on the item in the photo; take the picture as close as possible. Avoid shots of a distant bottle; instead, aim for a close-up, filling the frame.
- Brands are essential for impact. If there's a brand on the item, capture it in the photo. You can arrange or hold the item in a convenient way for the photo.
- In some cases, it might be valuable to show more than just grass with a bottle. For example, in a natural area with litter, it could make sense to hold the item with the nature in the background. Assess what's the right approach for each photo, ensuring the item is clearly visible.
- Not every photo necessarily needs to contain an item. While that's the main goal, it could be meaningful to first take a photo of a polluted area (1 photo with a lot of litter), then clean up (taking photos or not of each item), and finally take another photo from the same spot as the first one, but now without litter. These powerful photos can be used on social media, and our program has features to assist with that.
- Generally, we take one photo per item, but exceptions can be made. For example, in a place with 20 cigarette butts close together, taking 20 separate photos might not be very practical. However, if a photo, along with its characteristics, needs approval from someone else, they should still be able to see if, for instance, there are truly 20 in the photo.
- The litter doesn't necessarily have to be picked up. While it may sound counterintuitive because the goal is to make the world a bit cleaner, there could be reasons not to pick it up. The primary rule is, of course, to pick it up and dispose of it properly. However, there could be situations where it's not possible to pick it up immediately (consider your safety, like a pile of glass on a bike path). In such cases, taking a photo and later forwarding it to your local government or a group chat to ask for assistance might be useful. Another scenario could be encountering a large tire while running. Taking a photo and documenting it can still provide valuable data. Additionally, if you take a photo of a can and later notice two cigarette butts in the picture, you can document picking up the can and explicitly state that you chose not to pick up the two cigarette butts. This information could still be useful for others, regardless of whether you picked it up or not.
