# Taking a Photo

Taking a photo usually doesn't need much explanation: open your phone's camera and snap a picture. However, for litter photos, consider the following:

## GPS Location: 
We accept photos without GPS, but including a location can add value. Set your device to save GPS with your photo if you want this feature. Date and time are automatically saved.

## Photo Review:
You review your photo to assign characteristics since you know best what's in it. Ensure the photo is suitable for others to view by following these guidelines:

- Avoid recognizable people unless it's yourself.
- Focus on the litter item, taking close-up shots.
- Capture brand names clearly, if available.
- Show context if relevant (for instance take a wider shot to show the nature with the litter in it).

## Photo Content:
While the main goal is to photograph individual litter items, you can also decide to take broader shots with more than 1 item on it:

- Several similar kind of items in 1 pictures that you can tag faster, for instance several butts in 1 picture
- A broader shot of the environment with a lot of litter in it, then clean the area and and then the same shot, without the litter.

## Picking Up Litter:
While the goal is to clean up, there may be reasons not to pick up litter immediately (for instance safety concerns). Documenting it with a photo can still provide valuable data.
