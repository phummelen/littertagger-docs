# Taking a Photo

Taking a photo usually doesn't need much explanation: open your phone's camera and snap a picture. However, for litter photos, consider the following:

## GPS Location: 
We accept photos without GPS, but including a location can add value. Set your device to save GPS with your photo if you want this feature. Date and time are automatically saved.

## Photo Review:
You review your photo to assign characteristics since you know best what's in it. Ensure the photo is suitable for others to view by following these guidelines:

Avoid recognizable people unless it's yourself.
Focus on the litter item, taking close-up shots.
Capture brand names clearly, if available.
Show context if relevant (e.g., litter in nature).

## Photo Content:
While the main goal is to photograph individual litter items, broader shots can also be useful:

Take a 'before' and 'after' photo of a polluted area you clean.
One photo per item is typical, but exceptions can be made (e.g., multiple cigarette butts).

## Picking Up Litter:
While the goal is to clean up, there may be reasons not to pick up litter immediately (e.g., safety concerns). Documenting it with a photo can still provide valuable data.
