# Taking a Photo

Taking a photo usually doesn't need much explanation: open your phone's camera and snap a picture. However, for litter photos, consider the following:

## GPS Location: 
We accept photos without GPS, since those photos can tell a story as well, but including a location adds extra value. Set your device to save GPS with your photo. Date and time are automatically saved.

## Photo Review:
During the process of adding characteristics to the photo you will use the photo to see what is on it. In order to be best able to add the characteristics, try to follow these guidelines:

- Make sure the item is clearly visible (close-up) in the picture.
- if there is a brand on the item, feel free to move the item so you capture that brand as well
- if relevant, feel free to add the background as well, just try to exclude recognisable people on the photo (privacy etc).

## Photo Content:
While the main goal is to photograph individual litter items, you can also decide to take shots with more than 1 item on it:

- Several similar kind of items in 1 pictures so you can tag faster, for instance several butts in 1 picture
- A broader shot of the environment with a lot of litter in it, if you want to tag it as 'polluted area' or for instance take a picture before and after you clean up the area so you can show your impact and use one of our special tags 

## Picking Up Litter:
While our goal is to clean up the world, there may be valid reasons not to pick up the litter, for instance safety concerns or the item being too big etc. In that case you might still take a picture of it because it still tells a story. In that case you can use 'not picked up'.
