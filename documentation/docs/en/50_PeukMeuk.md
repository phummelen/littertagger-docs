# No Butts Day (#NoButtsDay)

The No Butts Day, or ButtSmutt (or **Plastic PeukMeuk** in Dutch) is an annual event that is not against smoking itself but rather against the plastic in cigarette butts, which pollutes nature. 

Conservative estimates suggest that 17 to 18 million cigarette butts end up on the streets every day. And that is just in the Netherlands!

At LitterApp, we participate in this event every year to raise awareness about this massive issue. Using LitterApp and a dashboard, we display our data on the map.

If you would like to join the PeukMeuk, there is nothing special you need to do. On the designated day, simply take a photo of a cigarette butt and upload it to LitterApp. Then, tag it as 'butt'. That's it. We will make sure that your pictures appear on the dashboard.

**Below are the numbers from previous years**
