# Mission and Vision

Although this project began with like-minded individuals because we couldn't find what we were looking for elsewhere, it's essential to keep an eye on the mission and vision. Because the more people involved, the more desires and ideas come into play, and before you know it, you might be trying to create an all-encompassing app that is beautiful but not necessarily feasible.

Therefore, we have a mission and a vision that we need to reflect on regularly. Are we still on the right track?

The mission articulates our purpose and core objectives, "Why do we exist, and what are we trying to achieve?"
The vision outlines our long-term goals and desired outcomes, "What does the world look like when we are successful, and what do we aim to accomplish?"

**Mission:**
"Our mission is to create a world where litter has no place. We aspire to inspire and support individuals in cleaning up litter through a user-friendly app. By harnessing the power of communities, we aim to make a sustainable impact on the environment and raise awareness about the importance of a clean living space."

**Vision:**
"Our vision is a world where communities unite to combat and prevent litter. Through our app, we not only aim to provide a platform for documenting litter but also to build a community that fosters engagement. We strive to use the gathered data to effect positive change, inform policymakers, and increase environmental awareness. By combining technology with community strength, we aim to catalyze a sustainable shift towards a cleaner and healthier planet."
