# Mission and Vision

We started this project with a clear vision of what we wanted to build and have been steadily working toward that goal. However, as more people join the project, each bringing their own ideas, we try to incorporate those into the system as well. Without proper direction, this could cause the project to veer off course. To prevent that, we developed a mission and vision to ensure we stay focused and on track.


**Mission:**

The mission articulates our purpose and core objectives, "Why do we exist, and what are we trying to achieve?"

"Our mission is to create a world where litter has no place. We aspire to inspire and support individuals in cleaning up litter through a user-friendly app. By harnessing the power of communities, we aim to make a sustainable impact on the environment and raise awareness about the importance of a clean living space."

**Vision:**

The vision outlines our long-term goals and desired outcomes, "What does the world look like when we are successful, and what do we aim to accomplish?"

"Our vision is a world where communities unite to combat and prevent litter. Through our app, we not only aim to provide a platform for documenting litter but also to build a community that fosters engagement. We strive to use the gathered data to effect positive change, inform policymakers, and increase environmental awareness. By combining technology with community strength, we aim to catalyze a sustainable shift towards a cleaner and healthier planet."
