# The TreasureHunt

The **TreasureHunt** (#TreasureHunt on the socials) is an event that (as far as I know) originated on Twitter. It started with a list of 10 items that the Litter Pickers needed to find. If you found an item, you posted a photo of it on Twitter and CornishSpliced kept scores.

The keeping scores was a lot of work though which is why I (Fred Steenbergen) and Maarten (aka The Lekjutter) offered to help out here and we kept scores via Excel.

At some point this stopped as well, which was a shame because the idea is perfect: Clean the world and while doing it, play a game.

And that is when I started to find a way to play this game, facilitated by LitterApp.net.

So here it is, the same game, played by people all over the world and scores are kept in LitterApp.

Each month we present a new list of 10 items that need to be found, ranging from (probably) easy to (hopefully) difficult. And then it is up to you: Go out, pick some litter and think about that list of 10 items and if you find one of them, you take a picture and upload it to LitterApp. After that you give the picture a lable, saying what kind of item it is and by doing so, we can also check the item that you claim to have found. Next you also give a special tag and if you do that, your item will be part of the game and you will enter the scoreboard.

The idea is simple and that is how we like it, because after all, it is just a game.

First person to find all items, is the winner, but that doesn't mean the game is over, we encourage the other people to continue the game. At the end of the month we write down who found how many items. But of course, this is all about sharing your stories, talk about litter, making it fun to clean the planet.

Are you going to give it a try? Feel free to join! The list and rules and scoreboard and even results from previous months can be found in the dashboard:
