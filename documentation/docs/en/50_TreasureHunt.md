# CornishSpliced TreasureHunt (#TreasureHunt)

The **TreasureHunt** is an event that takes place on Twitter and that you can find if you go to the @CornishSpliced-account.

At the start a list of some 10 items is presented and the idea is to go out, pick litter like you normally do and if you find 1 of the items on the list, you take a picture of it and post it on twitter, while tagging some people that will see if it is correct.

First person that finds all items, is the winner, but although that is the end-goal, actually it is more about people around the world getting together, picking litter, sharing ideas, stimulating other people to look around as well etc.

It is an event that takes place monthly (roughly) and sometimes they have a 'special edition' like special Christmas items around Christmas, or a country-edition where you don't have to find all the items, as long as somebody else from your country finds the other missing items.

We at LitterApp like this game a lot, it is a great way to create awareness around litter so we always participate and Fred Steenbergen has offered (apart from being the guy that keeps scores) to 'donate a litter pick as a price'.

When there is a winner of that months TreasureHunt, Fred will go out and pick 100 items.

And since we have LitterApp, we are also going to try to show some information about the TreasureHunt on this page.

Feel free to join!!!
