# Reporting Issues

Error-free software does not exist, and LitterApp is not exempt from errors. It is likely that you may encounter something that doesn't seem right. If you come across anything unusual, we would like to hear about it. This provides us with an opportunity to address the issue.

We use a Trello board to keep track of open requests and findings. Depending on the number of volunteers, their skills, and the importance of specific errors or requests, we will assess whether we have someone available to look into them. Please keep in mind that we undoubtedly have more requests and findings than people available to work on them. Therefore, it may take some time, but as long as the card is on our board, there is a chance it will be addressed.

We appreciate feedback. If something is not right, we want to know about it so we can take action.

Feel free to contact us and report the issue.
