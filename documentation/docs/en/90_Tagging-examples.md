# Examples of Found Litter and How to 'Tag' Them

The number and type of tags you use are up to you, but generally, 'the more information, the better.'

It is essential to realize that you are documenting characteristics primarily so that data can be utilized by yourself or others. Keep in mind that this is likely done by looking at the given characteristics rather than individual photos.

Consider a photo of a Coca-Cola can. This can be tagged in multiple ways, and the most common method might be:

- Item: Can
- Brand: Coca-Cola

This provides correct data that you or someone else can use. For instance, to answer questions like 'how many cans were found' or 'how many cans of the Coca-Cola brand were found.'

If you are willing to make the effort, you can provide much more information. Whether this additional information is useful or a waste of time might only become clear as people start using the data. For example, questions like:
- What percentage of found cans are made of aluminum, and how many are made of iron?
- How many cans had a deposit, and how many did not?
- How many cans were thrown away with other waste, and how many were separated for recycling?
- How many cans were found intact, slightly dented, flat, or torn into pieces (e.g., by a lawnmower)?
- How many cans still had content or were not even opened?

These are hypothetical questions, but they could be crucial for research on the functioning of can deposits in a particular country. However, these questions cannot be answered with just the first two characteristics given.

If you want to answer these sample questions, you might need to provide additional characteristics, like:
- Item: Can
- Brand: Coca-Cola
- Material: Aluminum
- Deposit: Yes
- Recycled: No
- Condition: Dented
- Content: No
- Unopened: No

As you can see, providing all these characteristics for each item could be a considerable amount of work. Finding a balance or efficient workflow is necessary.

It's challenging to know what information needs to be captured in advance. Trying to capture everything without knowing the information need is impractical. For instance, even if we document all the details mentioned, someone might be interested in the size of the can or whether the tab was still attached, and capturing every possible detail would be unmanageable.

## Complex Issues
### What is It?

## How to Capture Composite Items
One challenging issue is how to capture composite items.

For example, if we find a plastic Coca-Cola bottle, we might tag it as:
- Item: Bottle
- Brand: Coca-Cola
- Material: Plastic

This would provide the photo with the essential and correct characteristics.

But if we find the label that was around it, we might tag the photo as:
- Item: Label
- Brand: Coca-Cola
- Material: Plastic

This raises the question, 'shouldn't we also tag the Coca-Cola bottle with these two characteristics since it consists of the bottle and the label?'

Our stance is no. For us, it's a composite whole that belongs together. The same applies, for example, to the cap still attached.

But how does this work with a paper milkshake cup with a plastic lid and a paper straw from McDonald's?

If we say it's 'a cup,' we end up with:
- Item: Cup
- Brand: McDonald's
- Material: Paper

This is incorrect because someone using our data will use (the data from) this photo, thinking that only a cup was found, while this cup also had a lid (made of plastic even!) and a straw (made of paper, where plastic might be expected in many countries).

So, here we miss critical information.

Therefore, we (though not unanimously!) think you should represent this as three separate items:
- Item: Cup
- Brand: McDonald's
- Material: Paper

And
- Item: Lid
- Brand: McDonald's
- Material: Plastic

And
- Item: Straw
- Brand: McDonald's
- Material: Paper

By documenting it this way, it's evident that apparently, three things were found, all of the same brand but different in material.

But even this doesn't seem right because someone using this information won't know if these parts were separate (but coincidentally in one photo) or if they were still connected (e.g., the cup separately with the lid next to it, with the straw still inside). While this could be valuable information (e.g., why McDonald's is moving away from separate lids on some products), it can't be deduced from our data.

Therefore, at LitterApp, we have chosen an approach to solve this.

If they are all separate parts, you use the above method. However, if they are all still connected, you have a more specific option:
- Item: Cup (with the lid still on)
- Item: Lid (with the straw still inside)
- Item: Straw

This makes it clear that something unusual was happening in the original photo. Even though these are three separate objects, they were all still connected.

If, for example, you find a cup separately and then a lid with a straw inside, you could indicate the following items:
- Item: Cup
- Item: Lid (with the straw still inside)
- Item: Straw

And if you find a cup with a lid still on but the straw next to it, then the following:
- Item: Cup (with the lid still on)
- Item: Lid
- Item: Straw

This was a lengthy explanation, but we hope it clarifies that it's challenging to know in advance what to capture and how to do it. As mentioned earlier, everything is good, even a photo without characteristics can have value. The more you add, the better, but with the caveat that it could be data that will never be used. So, decide for yourself how much time and energy you want to invest.

The most crucial characteristics, from our perspective, are: Item and Brand (if present), and if possible, Material, assuming 'the worst material,' or possibly the 'most present material,' or possibly multiple materials (here, too, there are several possible ways, and there is no correct answer).
