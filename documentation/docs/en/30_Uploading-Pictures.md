# Uploading Photos

The uploading process is designed to be as simple as possible, and here is how it works:

## via the website

- Go to the website and log in with the user you created earlier.
- Navigate to the upload screen where a window appears. You can either navigate to a folder containing your photos and select them, or you can go to the folder first, select all the necessary photos, and drag them onto the screen. Once you release them, the uploading process begins.

Now it is a matter of waiting till the upload is done. You can see the progress for each selected photo, and in between, you can drag additional photos onto the screen, and they will be uploaded as well.
If the upload is ready, it will say 100%. If something went wrong on a photo, it might say something like 98%. In that case you can scroll down to the picture that failed (shown in red) and press the re-try-button.

The photos you upload are automatically resized to a format that is large enough to be displayed unchanged on the screen but requires much less storage capacity.

Once everything is uploaded, you can choose to go to 'My Photos' to start assigning characteristics, for example.

# Uploading via Mobile Phone

As of writing this documentation, we don't have an app available yet; that is planned for later. However, you can still perform actions via your phone. You can visit the website, log in, and upload photos. Keep in mind that you might incur costs or data usage when doing this on your phone. We also seem to encounter problems when you upload too much as once, so the preferred way is to move the pictures to the laptop first and then upload them, or do it by phone, in small batches.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact us!
