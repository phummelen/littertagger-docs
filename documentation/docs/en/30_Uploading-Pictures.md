# Uploading Photos

As of writing this documentation, the photo upload feature is already operational in the test environment we are currently using. However, there might be some changes you'll notice when we go 'live.'

The uploading process is designed to be as simple as possible, and here is how it works:

- Go to the website and log in with the user you created earlier.
- Navigate to the upload screen where a window appears. You can either navigate to a folder containing your photos and select them, or you can go to the folder first, select all the necessary photos, and drag them onto the screen. Once you release them, the uploading process begins.

During the upload, you may need to be patient (at least at the time of writing). Even though there are prompts to go to 'My Photos' in a few places, avoid doing that as it may interrupt the upload.

The photos you upload are automatically resized to a format that is large enough to be displayed unchanged on the screen but requires much less storage capacity. You can see the progress for each selected photo, and in between, you can drag additional photos onto the screen, and they will be uploaded as well.

Once everything is uploaded, you can choose to go to 'My Photos' to start assigning characteristics, for example.

# Uploading via Mobile Phone

As of writing this documentation, we don't have an app available yet; that is planned for later. However, you can still perform actions via your phone. You can visit the website, log in, and upload photos. Keep in mind that you might incur costs or data usage when doing this on your phone.
