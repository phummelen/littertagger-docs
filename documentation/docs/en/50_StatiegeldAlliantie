# Event Statiegeld Alliantie / Alliance pour la Consigne - Raising Awareness Through Daily Photos

On Twitter, there is an account called "Statiegeld Alliantie" that posts one photo of Belgian litter every day—litter that wouldn't be there if a deposit system had been implemented. These photos typically feature plastic bottles and cans.

Their mission is simple: To keep posting one litter picture every single day until Belgium introduces a deposit system.

At LitterApp, we know firsthand how effective deposit systems are in reducing litter. The impact is clearly visible in neighboring countries like the Netherlands, where such systems are already in place.

By March 2025, the Statiegeldalliantie had shared a significant number of photos. We decided to take their efforts a step further by integrating these images into LitterApp. Every photo they tweet is now also published in our app.

Since Twitter photos don’t include GPS coordinates, we make them up ourselves, thus creating a trail-like pattern that starts in Brussels.

We wholeheartedly support the Statiegeldalliantie’s mission and hope Belgium implements a deposit system soon!
